//  AppSelection.swift
//  DynastyStatDrop
//
//  Centralized season selection logic for all views.
//  OwnerId aware All Time selection
//  Added:
//   - Persistence of last selected league per username
//   - Helper to load persisted selection
//   - OwnerId aware team selection (uses Sleeper userId if available)
//   - Centralized season/team selection logic.
//   - Always prefers current year season if present.
//   - Exposes helpers for views to use and sync selection state.
