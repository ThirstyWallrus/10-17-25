//
//  AppSelection.swift
//  DynastyStatDrop
//
//  Centralized season selection logic for all views.
//  OwnerId aware All Time selection
//  Added:
//   - Persistence of last selected league per username
//   - Helper to load persisted selection
//   - OwnerId aware team selection (uses Sleeper userId if available)
//   - Centralized season/team selection logic.
//   - Always prefers current year season if present.
//   - Exposes helpers for views to use and sync selection state.
//
//  FIXED: Default team selection after Sleeper league import always matches user's team
//         by username (imported Sleeper username) and, if available, by userId.
//         Only falls back to first team if neither match is found.
//         Selection persists across all main views and only changes on explicit user action.
